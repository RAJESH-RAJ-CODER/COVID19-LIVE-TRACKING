So during this lockdown time letâ€™s create a COVID-19 Tracker AngularJs App using REST API which will track the Global Stats only.In web application, we usually need to communicate with Api from different locations of the angularjs controllers. So I prefer to wrap the web Api communication code in a angularjs service and call the service whenever you want.
